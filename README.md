The carbon-impact-project is a small app that takes 3 inputs: 
- the destination from which you took your flight
- the destination to which you went
- the number ok kilometers between the 2 places

When you click on "Add flight", the flight will be added to your flights list at the bottom of the page. For each flight is also calculated the tons of carbon emissions associated. 

Finally, as you enter flights, it calculates the total amount of carbon emissions and dynamically tells you with an emoticon how bad it is.
